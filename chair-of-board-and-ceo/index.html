<p>In a high-growth company most experts agree that a company benefits more when the CEO does not also serve as the board chair. In corporate governance and structure a President of a company holds the title of Chief Operating Officer COO. The biggest difference is that a chairman of the board promotes shareholder interests while a CEO is essentially the head of the company itself. The Chairman of a company acts as the Head of the Board of Directors or the Head of Trustees. Overall nothing is set in stone as far as whether the board chair and CEO roles should be combined or separate.
