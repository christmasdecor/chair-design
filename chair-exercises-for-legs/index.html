Exercise 4 Chair Marching First check your posture Lift alternate legs so that your feet lift about 2 inches from the floor and swing your arms forwards and back at a speed that is comfortable for you. Keep both legs at a 90-degree angle with the chair. Lift it as high as you can without your lower back rounding pause for a moment then lower your leg back down. Its amazing that we breathe automatically. Sit in a chair with your back straight and your arms at your sides.
