<p>A stool is generally distinguished from chairs by their lack of arms and a back. Backless chairs dont help health or personal comfort. Which is why the Soutien Ergonomic Office Chair is another solution for your office seating woes. Stools are generally better for the back for a few major reasons. Your back and core will thank you for using a backless stool. Chairs with high backs and plush seats offer more structure inviting guests to settle in and dine comfortably for longer stretches of time.

<p>Do not lean forward as it leads to hunching. Rest your feet flat on the ground. First a stool allows the back and spine to be in the natural position. Weve come far enough as a society to just say no to stools in favor of chairs for back support. As nouns the difference between chair and stool is that chair is an item of furniture used to sit on or in comprising a seat legs back and sometimes arm rests for use by one person compare stool couch sofa settee loveseat and bench while stool is a seat for one person without a back or armrest or stool can be a plant from which layers are propagated by bending its branches into the soil. Chairs with high backs and plush seats offer more structure inviting guests to settle in and dine comfortably for longer stretches of time.
