<p>For a standard 8-foot ceiling they should be installed about 32 inches from the floor. For instance an 8-foot ceiling will have a chair rail at 32 inches from the floor. To be the most visually appealing chair rails need to be installed at the right height. The short answer is about 3-4 feet or 13 of the ceiling height. Given that the rail is 3 12 and the baseboard is 4 12 inches or so that leave me with just just over two feet of wall space under the rail. There is another school of height which claims that the height is 13 the height of the ceiling which finds a major acceptance and is considered the golden rule of thumb but this may not work for very tall ceilings around 15 feet.
