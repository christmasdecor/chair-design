<p>Torsional strain- a pair of tetrahedral carbons attached to each other have their bond staggered. The chair conformation being the most stable and predominant form of cyclohexane is non-planar with the headrest and footrest bonds lying above and below the planar seat bonds. Most of the time the structure exists in what is called the chair conformation. Usually at room temperature around 25C all the molecules of cyclohexane occur in chair conformation. The equatorial bonds e are perpendicular to the axis of the ring while axial bonds a are parallel to the axis of the ring.</p>

<p>Carefully study this molecule by rotating it on. In the chair conformation of cyclohexane all the carbons are at 1095º bond angles so no angle strain applies. The stability is a consequence of no angle strain owing to the almost tetrahedral C-C-C bond angles and no torsional strain due to the perfectly staggered. If you have not already done so you should construct a model of cyclohexane now and use it to follow the subsequent discussion. The different conformations are called conformers a blend of the words conformation and isomer. The chair conformation being the most stable and predominant form of cyclohexane is non-planar with the headrest and footrest bonds lying above and below the planar seat bonds.
