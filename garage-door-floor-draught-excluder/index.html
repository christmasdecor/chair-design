<p>Reduces water ingress and debris such as leaves. The shape of the threshold helps to seal against the garage door and deflect water away from the inside. Width of seal 80mm closes gaps from 0mm to 18mm high. OK a draught excluder will possibly hold back a little chill but the whole fabric of the garage is not designed to hold heat in or cold out. Therefore you need the barrier between these 2 rooms rather than against the outside. Ive noticed the garage door has a 20-300mm wide rivetchannel which run all round the door.
