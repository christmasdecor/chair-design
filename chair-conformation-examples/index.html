<p>The chair conformation is considered to be the lowest energy conformation because it lacks this means that the chair conformation is the structure that is observable in most reactions of cyclohexane. First we have to introduce the concept of an A-value which is simply the energy difference between the equatorial most stable and axial least stable positions. Draw the ring flip for each of the following chair conformations. In the chair conformation there are two planes with carbon atoms alternating making carbon atoms 1 3 and 5 in one plane and carbon atoms 2 4 and 6 in another plane.
