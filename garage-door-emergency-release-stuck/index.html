<p>A Faulty Emergency Release. What is probably happening is first of all your garage door opener has too much down pressure or force on the door arm that your emergency release is connected to. By passing UL 325 standards the opener still needs an emergency release in case the door itself is stuck or someone gets caught underneath the garage door as it is closing. It will also put added stress on your electric garage door opener causing it to fail as well. If your door is stuck in the open position we recommend giving us a quick call so we can help remedy the situation safely. If door is closed open door all the way. 15 Reasons Why Your Garage Door Won T Open Or Close.</p>
